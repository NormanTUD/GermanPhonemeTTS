# IDEA

The idea for this script is very simple: record some phonemes for the german language, split words into phonemes
(done by https://github.com/bootphon/phonemizer ), and then try to find the longest matching audio file so that the
phonemes match.

The result is far from perfect, but way better than I've expected it to be.

# This also needs some perl modules and sox
